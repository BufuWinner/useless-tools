# **useless-tools**
What's better than a bunch of useless tools written in Python? Everything, and that's just perfect.

## What you will need
- Well... Python (otherwise check the [releases](https://github.com/BufuWinner/useless-tools/releases/) for the latest executable of the program, no need for Python)
- Some modules: **spotipy** (will try to remove it), **bs4**, **requests**

## Proposals
I'm open to any suggestion for new tools! Only one rule, it ***must*** be useless.
